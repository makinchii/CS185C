    "One good way to examine the construction of a model is to plot the bathymetry. The bathymetry for this model is stored in the `input/bathymetry.bin` file. Create a plot of the bathymetry below. Be sure to label your axes and give the plot a colorbar with a sensible color map.\n",

    "### Part 3: Run the Model\n",
    "After your compilation is complete, run the model in the `run` directory. \n",
    "\n",
    "Before running this model, make the following updates to the default tutorial:\n",
    "1. In the `data` file, change `nIter=0` to `nIter=70080` and place the the `pickup.0000070080.data`, `pickup.0000070080.meta`, `pickup_cd.0000070080.data` and `pickup_cd.0000070080.meta` files provided with this notebook in your run directory. This will allow you to start the model after it has already been run for several decades.\n",
    "2. Update the model timesteps to run for a duration of one year. Implement this change by looking in the `data` file to determine the number of seconds for each model timesteps (`deltaTClock`). Then, compute how many timesteps will be needed to run the model for one year by determining how many seconds are in one year (365 days) and dividing by the timestep. Then, update the timesteps on the line `nTimesteps=...,` in the `data` file.\n",
    "3. In the `data` file, add a new line for `useSingleCpuIO=.TRUE.,` in the `PARM01` section just below the line that says `readBinaryPrec=32,`.\n",
    "4. In the `data` file, in `PARM03`, update the following three lines as follows:\n",
    "```\n",
    " pChkptFreq= 31536000.,\n",
    "# dumpFreq=   864000.,\n",
    "# taveFreq=   864000.,\n",
    "```\n",
    "   Note that the comment indicators (`#`) must be in the first column.\n",
    "   \n",
    "5. Add the `data.diagnostics` file provided with this notebook into your run directory. This will request the model to output monthly averages of temperature (`THETA`), salinity (`SALT`), zonal velocity (`UVEL`), and meridional velocity (`VVEL`).\n",
    "6. In the file `data.pkg`, remove the line for `usePTRACERS=.TRUE.,` and add a new line for `useDIAGNOSTICS=.TRUE.,`.\n",
    "\n",
    "After making these changes, run the model. \n",
    "\n",
    "Again, you can refer to the class example or the [Getting Started with MITgcm](https://profmikewood.github.io/ocean_modeling_book/mitgcm/getting_started_with_MITgcm.html) section of the course notes for help."
